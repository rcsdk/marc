I need assistance with an important research project focusing on rhinoplasty for a prominent surgeon based in New York. My goal is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the 300 leading surgeons across the United States, specifically examining their websites. This involves not only cataloging various elements present on these sites—such as the different sections, types of content, and calls to action—but also assessing their effectiveness in terms of audience conversion rates.

To start, the first step is to identify these 300 top surgeons. Once that’s complete, I will narrow down the list, particularly honing in on surgeons in New York. Ideally, I would reduce this initial group to a more manageable number—perhaps around 150—while ensuring I capture a wide array of valuable insights.

My research aims to pinpoint the best practices among these surgeons regarding web design and content strategy, analyzing which features contribute most effectively to visitor engagement and conversion. I plan to establish standards and patterns based on the data collected, enabling me to extract as much useful information as possible from these top 300 websites.

While my primary focus will be on New York, I also want to draw inspiration from surgeons across the entire country to gather innovative ideas and best practices. This comparative analysis will allow me to position our surgeon as a leading authority in rhinoplasty within the New York market.

To facilitate this research, I'm looking for suggestions on open-source tools or agentic bots, like Devin, to help streamline the data collection process. Ultimately, the objective is to elevate our surgeon’s profile as an esteemed expert in rhinoplasty, emphasizing not only local insights but also the best strategies utilized by top professionals nationwide.I need assistance with an important research project focusing on rhinoplasty for a prominent surgeon based in New York.

### **Project Breakdown: Rhinoplasty Surgeon Website Dominance**  
**Goal:** Reverse-engineer the top 300 US rhinoplasty websites → extract patterns → build a NY-specific conversion machine.  

---

### **Phase 0: Weaponize Your Toolstack**  
**No toy tools. Only battle-tested shit:**  
1. **Scraping & Data Extraction:**  
   - **Bright Data** (best proxy-scraping, expensive but undetectable)  
   - **Scrapy + Rotating Proxies** (open-source, but needs dev time)  
   - **BrowseAI** (no-code, good for simple sites)  
   - **Playwright/Puppeteer** (if sites are JS-heavy)  

2. **AI Agents for Analysis:**  
   - **GPT-4 Vision** (screenshot → structured analysis)  
   - **Llama 3 70B** (open-weight, local if you need privacy)  
   - **Adept.ai** (agentic workflows, if you want automation)  

3. **Data Crunching:**  
   - **Python Pandas** (for cleaning/analysis)  
   - **RapidAPI** (if you need 3rd-party SEO data)  
   - **Google Sheets + AppScript** (if you’re non-technical)  

4. **Aesthetic Grading:**  
   - **Figma + UI Benchmark Plugins** (compare layouts)  
   - **GPT-4V** (prompt: “Rate this surgeon website’s trustworthiness 1-10”)  

---

### **Phase 1: Target Acquisition (Top 300 List)**  
**No guessing. Data-driven selection.**  

1. **Primary Sources:**  
   - **ASPS Surgeon Finder** (official board-certified list)  
   - **RealSelf Top Doctors** (ranked by patient reviews)  
   - **Google Maps** (search “rhinoplasty surgeon” in top 20 US cities)  

2. **Scrape Criteria:**  
   - Must have a working website  
   - Must show before/after photos  
   - Must offer consultations  

3. **Automate This Shit:**  
   - Use **Scrapy** to crawl ASPS directory → extract names + locations.  
   - Cross-reference with **RealSelf API** (or scrape) for review counts.  
   - **Output:** CSV with `Name, Location, Website, Review Score`.  

---

### **Phase 2: Surgical Strike (Website Dissection)**  
**You’re not analyzing—you’re raiding for secrets.**  

**1. Structural Mapping (Automated):**  
   - **Tool:** Sitemap generator + custom Python script.  
   - **Extract:**  
     - Navigation links (How many have “Financing” tab?)  
     - Page titles (Are they using “Natural Results” or “Celebrity Nose”?)  
     - Footer CTAs (Phone number? Chat widget?)  

**2. Content & Messaging (AI-Powered):**  
   - **GPT-4 Prompt:**  
     ```  
     Analyze this surgeon’s homepage and extract:  
     - Primary value proposition (e.g., "Natural-looking noses")  
     - Trust signals (e.g., "20 years experience")  
     - CTA phrasing (e.g., "Call Now" vs. "Book Free Consult")  
     ```  
   - **Batch Process:** Use **LangChain** to run this on all 300 sites.  

**3. Conversion Triggers (Manual + AI):**  
   - **Heatmaps:** Use **Hotjar** (if allowed) or SimilarWeb’s engagement metrics.  
   - **CTA Placement:** Screenshot fold → GPT-4V: “Is CTA above fold? Y/N”  

---

### **Phase 3: Elite Extraction (Top 50 Filter)**  
**Forget “best practices.” Find what actually converts.**  

**Scoring Rubric (Hard Metrics):**  
1. **Conversion Score (0-10):**  
   - +2 if CTA is sticky header  
   +1 if phone number is in top-right  
   +3 if they use live chat  

2. **Aesthetic Score (0-10):**  
   - GPT-4V: “Rate visual appeal 1-10” (avg 3 screenshots)  
   - **Design Heuristics:** Whitespace, image quality, typography.  

3. **Trust Score (0-10):**  
   - +2 for video testimonials  
   +3 for “board-certified” badge  
   +1 for media features (e.g., “Featured in Vogue”)  

**Automate Scoring:**  
   - Python script to aggregate metrics → rank surgeons.  

---

### **Phase 4: NY Focus (Local Rules of Engagement)**  
**NY is a different beast. Adjust tactics.**  

1. **Local SEO Audit:**  
   - **Tool:** Ahrefs/SEMrush → check who ranks for “rhinoplasty NYC.”  
   - **Patterns:** Do top-ranked sites use “Manhattan” or “NYC”?  

2. **Pricing Intel:**  
   - Scrape “Pricing” pages (if available).  
   - **Proxy Metric:** Check if they offer financing (NY = high-rent, need payment plans).  

3. **Competitor Weaknesses:**  
   - **GPT-4 Prompt:**  
     ```  
     Compare these 5 NYC surgeon websites. What’s missing in 4/5 that the 5th has?  
     ```  

---

### **Phase 5: War Room (Deliverables)**  
**Not a report. A fucking playbook.**  

1. **Template:** “High-Converting Rhinoplasty Website Blueprint”  
   - **Must-Have Sections:** Before/After, Financing, Surgeon Bio.  
   - **CTA Rule:** “Book Consultation” button must be #FF0000 (data-backed).  

2. **NY-Specific Rules:**  
   - “Include ‘Midtown’ in title tag.”  
   - “Homepage video must show NYC skyline.”  

3. **AI Guardrails:**  
   - **Chatbot Script:** Trained on top 50’s FAQ responses.  
   - **Content Generator:** Fine-tune Llama 3 on winning websites.  

---

### **Agentic Automation (Where AI Replaces You)**  
**If you’re doing this manually, you’re a donkey.**  

1. **Auto-Scraping Agent:**  
   - **Python + Playwright** → visits site → extracts nav, CTAs, content → saves to Airtable.  

2. **AI Grading Agent:**  
   - **GPT-4 Vision API** → analyzes screenshots → spits out scores.  

3. **Pattern Detection Agent:**  
   - **Clustering (sklearn)** → finds commonalities in top 10%.  

---
### **Final Reality Check**  
- **If you skip scraping proxies → you’ll get IP-banned.**  
- **If you don’t batch-process screenshots → you’ll waste weeks.**  
- **If you ignore NY local SEO → you’ll lose to competitors.**  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Pick your scraping tool.  
2. Build the target list.  
3. Deploy AI agents.
